# Review changes

Read the diff against the default branch and produce a structured list
of findings. The caller decides what to do with them — apply fixes
directly, post a review on GitHub, or both.

## Process

1. Resolve the default branch and diff:
   ```sh
   DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name)
   git diff "$DEFAULT_BRANCH"...HEAD
   ```
   Three-dot syntax shows just what this branch added, not unrelated
   changes that landed on the default branch since branching.

2. For larger diffs, do the read pass methodically yourself — read the
   changed files top to bottom before judging, so you don't carry the
   implementation's "obvious in context" bias. (Do not use sub-agents;
   the `task` tool is disabled.)

3. If a test suite exists, run it to verify the changes don't break
   anything. Check `package.json` scripts, `Makefile`, `pytest.ini`,
   `go.mod`, or CI workflow files for the test command. If tests fail
   on code unrelated to the diff, note it but don't flag it. If tests
   fail on changed code, add a `bug` finding.

4. Read every change against the PR's stated intent (PR body + linked
   issues via `gh issue view`). For each concern, classify it:

   - **bug** — logic doesn't match intent, broken edge case (null,
     empty, concurrency), incorrect assumption, factual error.
   - **test-gap** — new behavior added without test coverage on a
     critical path.
   - **style** — inconsistent with surrounding code (string quotes,
     brace style, naming).
   - **scope** — diff includes changes unrelated to the stated intent.
   - **docs** — stale comments or PR description doesn't match diff.

## Output format

Emit a JSON block as the FINAL part of your reply, exactly:

```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "kind": "bug" | "test-gap" | "style" | "scope" | "docs",
      "file": "<path/to/file>",
      "line": <number or null>,
      "summary": "<one sentence>",
      "suggested_fix": "<one or two sentences describing the fix>"
    }
  ]
}
```

If there's nothing to address, return `{ "findings": [] }`.

Keep `summary` and `suggested_fix` terse — one or two sentences each.
The fix-applier reading these has the file open already; don't restate
context the diff already carries.

## Confidence calibration

Assign a confidence level to each potential finding before including
it. See `references/confidence-calibration.md` for the full table.

- **HIGH** — you traced the code path and verified the issue. Report it.
- **MEDIUM** — the pattern is suspicious and likely wrong. Report it,
  noting uncertainty in `summary` if relevant.
- **LOW** — the code looks unusual but could be intentional. Do **not**
  report it.

Bug findings should almost always be HIGH. If you can't trace the
code path to confirm the issue, it's speculation — downgrade or drop.

## When to flag vs. not

- A `style` finding only counts if the PR's *neighbouring* code uses a
  different convention. Don't flag general taste preferences.
- A `test-gap` finding only counts when the missing test would have
  caught a real bug class — not "every new function needs a test."
- A `scope` finding is high-confidence: the diff demonstrably includes
  a change unrelated to the issue. When in doubt, don't flag.
- Don't include "everything looks good" notes in `findings`. Empty
  array is the correct positive signal.

## Not a finding

Before reporting, check `references/not-a-finding.md` for patterns
that look suspicious but are typically correct. Common examples:

- Null checks on values that "should" be set (defensive, valid if
  function is public or called from multiple sites)
- Empty catch blocks in error boundaries (framework convention)
- Trivial getters/setters (not worth a test-gap finding)
- Fixing a typo adjacent to changed code (not scope creep)
- TODO comments describing known limitations (not stale docs)
