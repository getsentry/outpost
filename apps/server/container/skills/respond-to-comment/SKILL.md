# Respond to Comment

Triage a comment on a PR the bot is involved in. Load `repo-setup` first.

## Self-loop guard

If the comment author equals your identity (`$ME` — see agent identity
setup), stop: `SKIPPED: own comment`.

## Triage

- **Actionable**: real bug, missing test, valid concern → fix it
- **Not actionable**: style preference, out of scope, already handled → reply with reason
- **Approval thumbs-up** (short body, no code refs): don't reply, stop

## Workflow

1. Check PR authorship — only push to your own PR's branch.
2. If actionable on your own PR: implement the fix, load `deslop`, commit,
   push, then reply on the thread with the commit SHA and resolve the thread
   (see below). After all fixes, re-request review.
3. If actionable on someone else's PR: reply with a `suggestion` block
   or description. Don't push.
4. If not actionable: reply on the thread with the reason and leave it open
   for a human to resolve.

## Replying to comments

There are two kinds of comments — reply to each in its own channel. **Never
use `gh pr comment` to answer an inline review comment**; that posts a
top-level PR comment that isn't attached to the thread.

**Inline review comment** (`pull_request_review_comment`, or a comment inside a
`pull_request_review`) — reply on the thread via the replies endpoint:

```sh
gh api -X POST \
  "repos/<OWNER>/<REPO>/pulls/<N>/comments/<COMMENT_ID>/replies" \
  -f body="Fixed in <SHA>."
```

`<COMMENT_ID>` is the review comment's `id` from the event payload (use the
top-level comment of the thread — the one with `in_reply_to_id` unset).

**Top-level PR comment** (`issue_comment` on a PR, not tied to a line) — reply
with:

```sh
gh pr comment <N> --body "..."
```

## Resolving a thread (only after you fixed it)

Resolve a review thread **only** when you pushed a code change that addresses
it. Leave won't-fix / not-actionable threads open with an explanatory reply.

1. Find the thread node id for the comment you addressed:

   ```sh
   THREAD_ID=$(gh api graphql -f query='
     query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
       repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
         pullRequest(number: $pr) {
           reviewThreads(first: 100) {
             nodes { id isResolved comments(first: 1) { nodes { databaseId } } }
           }
         }
       }
     }' -f owner=<OWNER> -f repo=<REPO> -F pr=<N> \
     --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[]
            | select(.comments.nodes[0].databaseId == <COMMENT_ID>) | .id')
   ```

2. Resolve it:

   ```sh
   gh api graphql -f query='
     mutation($threadId: ID!) {
       resolveReviewThread(input: { threadId: $threadId }) {
         thread { isResolved }
       }
     }' -f threadId="$THREAD_ID"
   ```

## Re-requesting review

After pushing fixes for a reviewer's feedback, re-request their review so they
see the PR is ready again:

```sh
gh api -X POST "repos/<OWNER>/<REPO>/pulls/<N>/requested_reviewers" \
  -f "reviewers[]=<REVIEWER_LOGIN>"
```

Keep replies concise and natural — write like a teammate, not a
support bot. No filler phrases, no emoji unless the thread uses them.

Don't push to others' branches. Don't force-push. Don't merge.
